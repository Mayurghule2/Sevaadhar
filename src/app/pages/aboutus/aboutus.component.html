          <p class="text-lg mb-5 ">OpenFuture Charity and Foundational Trust was founded in 2010 by a group of passionate individuals who
            witnessed firsthand the struggles faced by underprivileged communities. What began as a small local
            initiative has grown into a nationwide organization dedicated to creating sustainable change.</p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-5">Our journey started when our founder, Sarah Mitchell, volunteered at a local shelter
            and recognized the need for more comprehensive support systems. She gathered friends and colleagues who
            shared her vision, and together they created Hope Horizon with a simple mission: to provide hope and
            practical assistance to those who need it most.</p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-5">Over the past decade, we've helped thousands of individuals access education,
            healthcare, and essential resources. We've built schools in rural areas, established medical camps in
            underserved communities, and created vocational training programs to empower people with the skills they
            need to build better futures.</p>
          <p class="text-lg mb-5">Today, Hope Horizon continues to expand its reach and impact, guided by the same core
            values that inspired its creation: compassion, integrity, and a belief in the inherent dignity of every
            human being.</p>
