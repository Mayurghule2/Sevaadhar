    <p class="text-md md:text-lg mb-6">
      Disaster response is the second phase of the disaster management cycle. It consists of a number of elements, for example warning/evacuation, search and rescue, providing immediate assistance, assessing damage, continuing assistance and the immediate restoration or construction of infrastructure. The aim of emergency response is to provide immediate assistance to maintain life, improve health and support the morale of the affected population. Such assistance may range from providing specific but limited aid, such as assisting refugees with transport, temporary shelter, and food to establishing semi-permanent settlement in camps and other locations.
